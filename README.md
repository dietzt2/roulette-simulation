# spinner-simulation
Built to test two roulette-style spinners.
The two spinners are uploaded as images in issues under "Images for README". The spinner on top is referenced as 'spinner1' and the bottom as 'spinner2'.

The files 'spinner.h', 'spinner.cpp', and 'spinner_section.h' are required to use the spinner. The file 'simulation.cpp' is built to test and use the spinners. Currently, it tests the 'Spinner' class by comparing the simulated expected value of each spinner to the known expected value (4.0 and 4.875, respectively). 

To use the 'Spinner' class, include the 'spinner.h', 'spinner.cpp', and 'spinner_section.h' files to a project.
